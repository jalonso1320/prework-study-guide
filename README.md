# prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation for this study guide is to help boot camp students and myself by having my HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript notes as reference and easy access.
I built this project as a guide to help me better understand HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript and to give me a base of where to start so I can keep bettering myself in these languages. This project helps me keep ,y notes organized for myself and for anyone who sees it. I learned the basics of these languages.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used as a reminder or as a guide for new and experienced users. Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
